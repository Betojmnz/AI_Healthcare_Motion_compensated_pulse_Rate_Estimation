# Motion Compensated Pulse Rate Estimation
## Overview
Creation of a pulse rate algorithm and a clinical application of it

## Algorithm specs
* Estimates pulse rate from the PPG signal and a 3-axis accelerometer.
* Assumes pulse rate will be restricted between 40BPM (beats per minute) and 240BPM
* Produces an estimation confidence
* Produces an output at least every 2 seconds

## Clinical application
An exploratory data analysis is performed to validate if the algorithm has feasible a use case
